        <h1>Request primers</h1>

        <p>PolyMarker is an automated bioinformatics pipeline for SNP assay
            development which increases the probability of generating
            homoeologue-specific assays for polyploid species. PolyMarker generates a
            multiple alignment between the target SNP sequence and the selected
            reference genome (from the drop off menu in green below). It then
            generates a mask with informative polymorphic positions between
            homoeologs which are highlighted with respect to the target genome.</p>

        <p>See <a href="https://www.polymarker.info/about">About</a> to know how to prepare your input. For wheat, we
            have <a href="https://www.polymarker.info/designed_primers">designed primers</a> for the iSelect 90K chip
            and the Axiom 820k chip.</p>

        <p>If your request is terminated due a timeout, try with less markers and make sure the SNPs are not in low
            complexity regions. </p>

Initially multiplexed  short read BAC by BAC contig assemblies (N50: 79 kb) were scaffolded using physical, genetic  and optical maps (N50: 1.9 Mb) and were assigned to chromosomes using a POPSEQ genetic map.  Finally, the linear order and orientation of scaffold sequences was determined using  [chromosome-conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C)](http://wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromosome_conformation_capture).
The final chromosome-scale assembly consisted of 6,347 ordered super-scaffolds composed of  merged assemblies of individual BACs, representing 4.79 Gb (~95%) of the genomic sequence content,  of which 4.54 Gb have beenassigned to precise chromosomal locations in the Hi-C map.
The chloroplast genome component and its gene annotation are also present ([KC912687](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena/data/view/JQ754651)).

                                whole genome assembly has been carried out by the IWGSC in
                                collaboration with the company NRGene. Using a proprietary algorithm
                                DeNovoMAGIC with Illumina sequencing data a 14.5 Gb assembly was
                                produced. Sequences have been ordered using POPSEQ data and Hi-C
                                (chromosome conformation capture) to generate 21 pseudomolecules
                                representing the majority of the wheat genome. Reference sequence
                                available in <a href="https://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository/Annotations">URGI</a>
                                The assembly is described in <a href="https://doi.org/10.1126/science.aar7191">IWGSC
